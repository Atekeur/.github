TAGGRS was developed for and by marketers. Our goal is to make the best tracking accessible to every company. Tracking can make or break your marketing campaigns, but good tracking is becoming increasingly complex. Changing laws and new requirements in the field of privacy make it harder and harder to get good data.

With TAGGRS, we put you back in control. With Server Side Tracking, you are in charge of your own data and have 100% insight and accuracy. Use the data for analysis or for measuring conversions. You decide.
